This basic version of memotables is implemented on top of existing LVars without
breaking any rules.

The problem is that it cannot do cycle detection, because that requires tracking
extra information (where we've been) which is NOT exposed to the user and NOT used

-- FIXME!!! Where do errors in the memoized function (e.g. multiple put) surface?
-- We must pick a determined, consistent place.

-- Multiple put errors may not be able to wait until this point to get
-- thrown.  Otherwise we'd have to be at least quasideterministic here.  If you have
-- a MemoFuture you never force, it and an outside computation may be racing to do a
-- put.  If the outside one wins the MemoFuture is the one that gets the exception
-- (and hides it), otherwise the exception is exposed.  Quasideterminism.

-- It may be fair to distinguish between internal problems with the MemoFuture
-- (deferred exceptions), and problematic interactions with the outside world (double
-- put) which would then not be deferred.  Such futures can't be canceled anyway, so
-- there's really no need to defer the exceptions.
